## Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

Task Formulation
Fake news's simple meaning is to incorporate information that leads people to the wrong path. Nowadays fake news spreading like water and people share this information without verifying it. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.

For media outlets, the ability to attract viewers to their websites is necessary to generate online advertising revenue. So it is necessary to detect fake news.

And in this project we'll be doing that using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK, re (Regular Expression), Scikit Learn.
