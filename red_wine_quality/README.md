## Red Wine Quality Linear Regression

#### Task Formulation
Wine is an alcoholic beverage that has been popular for thousands of years. There are 3 main types of wine - red, white, and rose. These types of wine differ in their base and production processes. Red wine is made by fermenting the juice of dark grapes. During red wine production, the winemaker allows pressed grape juice, called must, to macerate and ferment with the dark grape skins, which adds color, flavor, and tannin to the wine. Alcohol occurs when yeast converts grape sugar into Ethanol and Carbon Dioxide.

Red wine is one of the popular alcoholic drinks nowadays and there is a variety of wine brands out there. So, often people get curious about the quality of red wine. But it becomes a quite complicated task as people don't know how to analyze wine without special knowledge. This special knowledge includes the ability to understand what kind of specific conditions affect the wine quality. Therefore, wine consumers usually rely on ratings and reviews made by a specialist. And sometimes these feedbacks are mutually exclusive and don't help to make the right decision in front of the wine shelves.

To solve this problem, we can use __Python__ to analyze available data. This data can be used to __predict the quality__ of the red wine given certain variables or factors.
